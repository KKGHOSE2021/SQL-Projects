In this project, SQL SELECT statement is used to query a database. Different SQL operators together with the WHERE clause are used to set conditions on tables of a database for database manipulation.

# Project Structure
The hands on project on Querying databases using SQL SELECT statement is divided into following tasks:

## Task 1: SELECT - FROM

1.1 Retrieve all data from the employees, departments, employees and salaries tables

## Task 2: SELECT - FROM AND WHERE
2.1 SELECT data FROM a table

2.2 SELECT data FROM a table by setting conditions using the WHERE clause

3.2 SELECT data FROM a table using OR with the WHERE clause

3.3 SELECT data FROM a table taking note of operator precedence

3.4 SELECT data FROM a table using IN & NOT IN with the WHERE clause

## Task 4: Wildcard Characters

## Task 6: Other Comparison Operators
6.1 SELECT data FROM a table using equal to and not equal to in the WHERE clause

6.2 SELECT data FROM a table using greater than, greater than and equals to in the WHERE clause
