In this project, SQL Mathematical functions are used to perform data aggregation, reporting, and manipulation for database insights using the employees database.

# Project Structure
The hands-on project on SQL Mathematical Functions is divided into the following tasks:

## Task 1: Getting Started

1.1 Retrieve all the data in the employees, sales, salaries, and customers table 

## Task 2: CEIL() & FLOOR()
2.1 Use the CEIL() and FLOOR function on the number 4.7 

2.2 Retrieve a list of sales and the smallest value larger than each sales value

2.3 Retrieve a list of sales and the largest value smaller than each sales value

2.4 Find the total sales revenue if you are:
(a) charging the lower integer value always
(b) charging the higher integer value always

## Task 3: RANDOM() & SETSEED()
3.1 Retrieve a random decimal between 0 and 1

3.2 Retrieve a random decimal between a range 10 and 20

3.3 Use the SETSEED() function to return the same values

3.4 Retrieve a list of five lucky customers using the RANDOM() function

## Task 4: ROUND() & TRUNC()
4.1 Round 45.366 to the nearest whole number

4.2 Round 45.366 to 2 decimal places

4.3 Find the total sales revenue if you are:
(a) charging the lower integer value always
(b) charging the higher integer value always
(c) rounding off the sales always

## Task 5: ROUND() - Part 2
5.1 Round the average salary to the nearest whole number

5.2 Round the average salary to a precision of cents.

5.3 Find the range for salary

## Task 6: SQRT() & CBRT()
6.1 Find the square root of 25

6.2 Find the cube root of 64

6.3 Find the standard deviation of the age of customers

6.4 Tidy up the result to 3 decimal places

## Task 7: POWER()
7.1 Find the value of 5 raised to power 3

7.2 Find the square of the age of customers
