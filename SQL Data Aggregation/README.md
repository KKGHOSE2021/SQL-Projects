In this project, SQL aggregate functions are used to perform data aggregation for database insights.

# Project Structure
The hands-on project on Performing Data Aggregation using SQL Aggregate Functions is divided into the following tasks:

## Task 1: Introduction

1.1 Retrieve all data from the employees, departments, employees and salaries tables

## Task 2: COUNT()
2.1 Retrieve data from the employees table using the COUNT function

2.2 Retrieve data from the salaries table using the COUNT function

## Task 3: SELECT DISTINCT & GROUP BY
3.1 SELECT DISTINCT data from tables in the employees database

3.2 Retrieve data from tables in the employees database using the GROUP BY statement

3.3 Use the COUNT function together with SELECT DISTINCT and GROUP BY statements

## Task 4: HAVING
4.1 Understand the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clause

4.2 Use HAVING to set conditions on result set of aggregate functions

## Task 5: SUM()
5.1 Retrieve the total sum of salary from the salaries table

5.2 Retrieve the total sum of salary from the salaries using a WHERE clause

## Task 6: MIN() & MAX()
6.1 Retrieve the minimum and maximum salary from the salaries table

6.2 Retrieve the minimum and maximum employee number from the employees table      

## Task 7: AVG()  
7.1 Retrieve the average salary from the salaries table

7.2 Retrieve the average salary from the salaries using a WHERE clause

## Task 8: ROUND() 
8.1 Round the results from task 6 up to nearest whole number and decimal places

8.2 Perform arithmetic operations, for example, retrieve the range of salary from the salaries table
